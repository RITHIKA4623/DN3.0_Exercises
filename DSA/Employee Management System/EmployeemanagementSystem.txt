Array Representation:

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that store elements in contiguous memory locations.
Advantages include constant-time access to elements (O(1)), easy traversal, and simple implementation.

Time Complexity Analysis:

Add Employee: 

O(1) if space is available.
Search Employee: O(n) in the worst case, as it may require checking all elements.
Traverse Employees: O(n), as each element needs to be visited.

Delete Employee:

 O(n) in the worst case, as it may require searching for the element to delete.
Limitations of Arrays:

Fixed size: 

Arrays cannot grow or shrink dynamically, leading to wasted space or overflow.
Inflexible: Insertions and deletions can be inefficient, especially in large arrays.
Use Cases: Arrays are suitable for scenarios where the size is known in advance and random access is required.

By understanding and implementing these concepts, we can efficiently manage employee records using arrays in the Employee Management System.
