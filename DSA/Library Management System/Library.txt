1.Search Algorithms:

Linear Search:
 This algorithm sequentially checks each element in the list until the target element is found or the list ends. It has a time complexity of O(n).
Binary Search: This algorithm repeatedly divides the sorted list in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements each time until the target element is found or the list ends. It has a time complexity of O(log n).

2.Time Complexity Analysis:

Linear Search:
 O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of books. It is straightforward but can be inefficient for large datasets.

Binary Search:
 O(log n) in the worst case, where n is the number of books. It is much faster for large sorted datasets but requires the list to be sorted.

3.When to Use Each Algorithm:

Linear Search:
 Suitable for small or unsorted datasets. It does not require sorting and is simple to implement.
Binary Search: 
Suitable for large sorted datasets. It is more efficient for large datasets but requires the list to be sorted, which adds an overhead if the list is frequently updated.

By implementing these concepts, we can efficiently search for books in the Library Management System using both linear and binary search algorithms.
