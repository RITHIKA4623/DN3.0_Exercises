Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort: 
A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case.

Quick Sort:
 A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average and O(n^2) in the worst case.

Time Complexity Analysis:

Bubble Sort:

 O(n^2) in the worst and average cases. It is inefficient for large datasets.
Quick Sort: O(n log n) on average. It is much faster than Bubble Sort for large datasets.
Comparison:

Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement but is inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.

Quick Sort is more complex but is generally preferred for its superior average-case performance of O(n log n), making it suitable for large datasets.

By implementing both sorting algorithms, we can see that Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort for sorting large datasets due to its better average-case time complexity.
