1.FinancialForecasting.java:

Contains the methods for calculating future values using recursion and memoization.
Provides a simple recursive method (predictFutureValue) and an optimized method using memoization (predictFutureValueMemo).

2.FinancialData.java:

Encapsulates the financial data such as initial value, growth rate, and number of years.
Provides getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the financial data.

3.ForecastingApp.java:

Main application class that initializes the financial data and performs forecasting using both the simple recursive method and the memoized method.
Demonstrates the usage of the FinancialForecasting methods and outputs the results.

By organizing the project into these three files, we can maintain a clean separation of concerns and make the code more modular and manageable.
