Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List:

 Each node contains data and a reference to the next node. It allows for efficient insertions and deletions.
Doubly Linked List: Each node contains data and references to both the next and previous nodes. It allows for traversal in both directions but requires more memory.

Time Complexity Analysis:

Add Task: 
O(n) in the worst case, as we need to traverse the list to find the end.
Search Task: O(n) in the worst case, as we may need to traverse the entire list.
Traverse Tasks: O(n), as each element needs to be visited.

Delete Task: 
O(n) in the worst case, as we may need to traverse the entire list to find the element to delete.
Advantages of Linked Lists:

Dynamic Size: 

Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically, avoiding the fixed size limitation of arrays.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Insertions and deletions are efficient, especially when they occur at the beginning or middle of the list.

By implementing these concepts, we can efficiently manage tasks using a singly linked list in the Task Management System.
